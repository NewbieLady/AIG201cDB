A specialized subset of machine learning
Recurrent neural network
Verifies generated data
IoT devices collect data and send it via the internet to the cloud for storage and analysis.
Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning
AI that allows devices to process data and make decisions locally
Edge computing refers to processing data closer to where it is generated, such as on IoT devices, to reduce latency and bandwidth use.
Deep learning models can automatically extract features from raw data without the need for manual feature engineering.
To introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron, enabling the network to learn complex patterns.
